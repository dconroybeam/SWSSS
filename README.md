### Summer Workshop in Simulating Social Systems (2023)

### TTH 2-5p, F 10-11a

### Psych. East 3834

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Instructor: Daniel Conroy-Beam

Email: <dconroybeam@ucsb.edu>

<br> The goal of this workshop is to cover the basics of programming agent-baesd models in R. We will cover the basics of programming in R and practice building simulations of social systems. Students will additionally plan an agent-based model on a topic of their choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Workshop Structure:

**Core Meetings (T, TH):** Dr. Conroy-Beam and students will meet
weekly in person in Psych. East 3834 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2-5p. Most meetings will consist of students and Dr. Conroy-Beam working together to write an agent-based model on a classic topic in R.

**Section Meetings (F):** Graduate students Ashley Coventry and Carlos Sosa Colindres will host short supplemental sections each Friday in Psych East 3834. These will go further in-depth on an R programming topic relevant to the workshop and help students plan their own agent-based model.
